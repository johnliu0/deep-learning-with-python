# Deep Learning with Python

This repository contains code snippets from "Deep Learning with Python", written by Francois Chollet; creator of Keras, a deep learning framework for Python. This is an absolute must-read for any new machine learning enthusiast. The book focuses primarily on deep learning and applying deep learning to code with Keras and Python.

The code I write here is taken right from the book along with some modifications. I experiment with what the book has to offer and add my own ideas to the code.
